The real difference between Random Forest and Bagging with Decisioin Tree as base model is,
In Bagging when we do column sampling, the whole split (child and leaf node) is done based on those particular columns.
Meanwhile, In Random Forest the whole split is done randomly on all columns after the main split thus bringing
extra randomness to the model.

- Mostly all the parameters are same in Regressor and Classifier, expect for the criterion part. Regressor
has {MSE, MAE}, while Classifier has {gini, entropy}.

- We can use RandomSearchCV or GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for our model. Before that,
we have to input some values for the parameters we want to fine-tune and fit them to check for the best ones 
i.e. which gives high score.

Under Sampling

Advantages:
- Reduction in bias
- Faster in training

Disadvantages:
- Information loss leading to underfitting
- Sampling bias

Over Sampling

Advantages:
- Reduction in bias

Disadvantages:
- Increases size
- Duplication of data may cause overfitting

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique)

Advantages:
- Can be used in reducing bias

It has a lot more disadvanatges:
- Does not handle caegorical data well
- Computational complexity
- Dependency on the choice of neighbours
- Sensitive to outliers

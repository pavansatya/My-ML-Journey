# Sigmoid function's derivative = sigmoid function (1 - sigmoid function)

|                      | **Predicted: Positive** | **Predicted: Negative** |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Actual: Positive** | **True Positive (TP)**  | **False Negative (FN)** |
| **Actual: Negative** | **False Positive (FP)** | **True Negative (TN)**  |

- To make this simple, if predicted response is positive then it is either true positive or negatived
  based on the actual response. If predicted response is negative then it is either false positive or true 
  negative based on the actual response.

# Type 1 error - The no. of False Positives (FP) in the model are the type 1 error.

# Type 2 error - The no. of False Negatives (FN) in the model are the type 2 error.

** In an imbalanced dataset, the model will always be biased towards the majority class. 
So, accuracy is not the correct metric to evaulate model's performance.  **

# Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

# Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

# Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

# So, based on the domain knowledge, data we are working on, and the model we are using, 
  we need to choose the correct metric to evaluate the model's performance. As, it is subjective 
  to the target variable.

# If we are unsure about the target variable or don't have domain knowledge to choose the metric
  incase of a tie with accuracy, we then use F1-score. It is the harmonic mean of precision and 
  recall. It is the best metric to evaluate the model's performance in case of imbalanced dataset.

| You Know the Cost?     | Use...       |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| Yes — FP worse         | Precision    |
| Yes — FN worse         | Recall       |
| No — unsure/mixed case | **F1-Score** |


# Logistic regression is a specialization of softmax regression for 2 classes. 
  The reason why we use softmax is, Logistic fails when there are multiple classes (more than two).

- To use softmax regression i.e. multinomial regression, we just add extra parameter inside Logistic
i.e. multi_class = `multinomial`.

Core point is the one where in given epsilon (hyper parameter) we have number of points >= Minpnts (hyper parameter). 
Border point is the one, the has atleast one core point and less number of points inside its epsilon radius than Minpnts.
Neither points are the ones that are neither Core points nor Border points.

| Sensitivity | Examples                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Low         | Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Linear Models |
| Medium      | KNN, Decision Trees, K-Means              |
| High        | XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks             |

| Aspect             | Clustering (Unsupervised)     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Train-test split?  | ❌ Not typically used          |
| Labels required?   | ❌ No                          |
| Evaluation metrics | ✅ Silhouette, WCSS, DBI, etc. |
| When to split?     | ✅ Only in downstream tasks    |
